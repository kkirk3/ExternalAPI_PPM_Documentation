   This endpoint allows the user to delete a payee name from a given lockbox. The data is first validated in the ECHO Hub system and is directed to the ECHO Hub internal lockbox endpoint. The request is then sent to the lockbox express library for deleting a payee name from the lockbox. Once the payee’s name is deleted, the ECHO Hub system will send a success message.  

   This endpoint uses ‘lbxDirectoryId’ & 'payeeId' as the input parameters.  
   * lbxDirectoryId – This is a unique identifier for a payee and the associated P.O box.
   * payeeId – This is the unique identifier for the payee. The payee is identified with the payee ID.   

   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
