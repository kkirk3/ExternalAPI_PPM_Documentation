   This endpoint allows the API user to create a Payment to the Payee.  
   The Payor is identified with the unique Payor reference ID. This is the Payor’s unique reference ID for them to access the status or cancellation of the Payment. 
   This is unique to all payments submitted by a Payor.

   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization
     token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
