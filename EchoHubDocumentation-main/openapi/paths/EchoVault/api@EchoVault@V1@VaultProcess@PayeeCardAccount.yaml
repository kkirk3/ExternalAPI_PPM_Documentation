   This API enables a consumer to identify the payee account for PCI-compliant payment from an embedded web application. The payee can be identified as having an existing account token or the request can add a payee’s new account information. This API is consumed when a provider selects to be paid.  

   When the consumer provides the payment details in the embedded web application and clicks the submit button, the card/payment information gets captured by ECHO Vault through this endpoint. If the account/card details already exist, the details are retrieved during the next new active session.
  
   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
