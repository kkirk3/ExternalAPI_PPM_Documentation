   This endpoint allows the API user to identify a payee account for a Zelle payment from an embedded web application. The payee can be identified as having an existing account token or the request can add a Zelle payee’s information. This API is consumed by the Deluxe MPX portal, SelectPay application, and B2B application when a provider selects to be paid via Zelle.  

   When the request is received from a web object, the session token is validated, and the vault token is determined. Once the vault token is obtained, the data is passed to the ECHO Vault Zelle library to create a payee.
  
   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
