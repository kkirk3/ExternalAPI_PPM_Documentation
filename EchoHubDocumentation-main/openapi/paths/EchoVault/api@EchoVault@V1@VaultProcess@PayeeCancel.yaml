   This endpoint allows the API user to close the embedded web application at the request of the payee. This API is consumed by the WYSIWIG. When a payee clicks the cancel button in the embedded web application, the active session token will be deactivated.  

   When the cancel button is clicked, the request is sent to the ECHO Vault. The session token is deactivated, and the session will end and stop the payment request. A webhook will notify the calling application.
  
   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
