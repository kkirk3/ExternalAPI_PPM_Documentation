   The SelectPay application consumes this API while requesting an ACH payment. This endpoint enables the SelectPay application to request ECHO Hub to make an ACH payment to the payee.  

   When there is a request for ACH payment from the SelectPay form, the data is passed to the ECHO Hub system requesting to make an ACH payment. Once, the data is validated in the ECHO Hub system, the request is sent to the SelectPay library. On successful payment, the ECHO Hub will send a success message.  
  
   Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization token by using the API key and the Client key. This authorization token is valid for 30 minutes.
